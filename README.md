# sqlalchemy-challenge
The purpose of this assignment is to examine climate data from Honolulu, Hawaii. The data that is being analyzed is available in the hawaii.sqlite database, where there are two tables titled 'measurement' and 'station' which contain data about the temperature and precipitation at the unique stations on certain dates.

# To Run
The Jupyter notebook (climate_starter.ipynb) can be ran cell-by-cell or as a whole to produce the results and plots. The Python file (app.py) will need to be ran in the terminal, and then the page can be opened in a browser, where each of the routes can be accessed.
